## Kubernetes Operators

> Operators are Kubernetes native applications

> Gone are the days of deploying an etcd cluster using a complicated collection of stateful sets, crds, services, and init containers to manage bootstrapping and lifecycle management, et cetera

* Operators are software written to encapsulate all of those operational considerations for a specific Kubernetes application: configuration, deployment, upgrades, monitoring and failure-handling

> stateless is easy, stateful is hard

> Database operators allow Kubernetes users to safely deploy and manage certain databases without needing to build their own workarounds

* Human knowledge as code
