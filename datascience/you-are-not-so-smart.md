# Random Notes on the Book: You are not so smart by David McRaney

## Confirmation Bias

You start seeing more objects and information on a topic, when that topic on your mind.

Like if you are having a baby, you are more likely to see babies.

You watch pundits not for information but confirmation. You want him to confirm what you think.

> People like to be told what they already know, they get uncomfortable when you tell them new things

You want to be right about how you seee the world

In science you get closer to the truth by seeking out opposite or other ways of thinking
