# Python for Data Analysis Notes

## What Data?

* Tabular like a CSV or excel
* Multi-dimensional arrays (matrices)
* Related data tables
* Evenly spaced out time series

## Why Python?

**Not from the book**

Because it is the best.

Python can be used at any stage research to prototyping to production systems.

## Why not python?

It's maximum performance is not great due to it being interpreted and not compiled.
The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) prevents the interpreter from running more than 1 instruction at a time.
Developer time is more important than CPU time in most cases so it is a good tradeoff.

## Essential Python Libraries

### Numpy
