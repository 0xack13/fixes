# Setting python path with VS code

Sometimes its a hack getting vscode to find the correct path for the python project you are working on at the minute

So if you check [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37642045/use-virtualenv-with-python-with-visual-studio-code-in-ubuntu)

You will find you can just type:

    Shift + Command + P

Type:

    Select Workspace Interpreter

Then select the correct environment
