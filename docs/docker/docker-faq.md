## Can you access a docker container directly via it's internal ip or do you have to bind to the host port

You can, but not on mac.

Inspecting your containers ip will gives its internal ip.

[Docker Desktop for Mac canâ€™t route traffic to containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#i-cannot-ping-my-containers), do you won't be able to ping or access it.

Weirdly you can nmap that private ip.
