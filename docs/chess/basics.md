## Opening

> control center the center, avoid the edge where possible

knight on the rim is dim

control d4 e4,d5 and e5 with pawns

knights must protect the center

You can block your own pieces

`castle early and castle often`

Safety of king behind pawns...

You can't castle out of check

Key is to make your pieces active...gradually making position greater.

Understand yout opponent. What seems obvious might be a red herring for other intentions.

> Always look at your opponents move

When we are attacked, it's easy to only think about defensive moves and overlook our own resources

Goals:

* Control the center
* Get your pieces on active squares
* Get your king to safety by castling
