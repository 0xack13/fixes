## Magento 2 Learning Bootcamp

What do you need to learn Magento 2 (coming from being an average Magento 1 dev)

I would suggest starting on the right foot in a pragmatic and non theory driven manner.

1. Install Magento 2 and [setup integration tests](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/test/integration/integration_test_setup.html)

2. Watch [Mage 2 Katas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRFDWo7jTlrpEsJxzc7WyPw) By Vinai Kopp
