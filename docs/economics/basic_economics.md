“inefficiencies in turning inputs into outputs translated into a lower standard of living”

Markets coordinated by price movements - capitalism, as it is called - is the natural way of things

“Although a free market economic system is sometimes called a profit system, it is in reality a profit-and-loss system—and the losses are equally important for the efficiency of the economy, because losses tell producers what to stop doing—what to stop producing, where to stop putting resources, what to stop investing in”

Excerpt From: Thomas Sowell. “Basic Economics 4th Ed.” iBooks. 

“Losses force the producers to stop producing what consumers don’t want” - they don't even have to know why.

Excerpt From: Thomas Sowell. “Basic Economics 4th Ed.” iBooks.

“The staggering number of economic transactions, on ever-changing terms as supply and demand vary almost continuously, is beyond the knowledge and capacity of any individual or any manageable-sized group of planners to direct in any economy, much less in the world market”

Excerpt From: Thomas Sowell. “Basic Economics 4th Ed.” iBooks.

“The significance of free market prices in the allocation of resources can be seen more clearly by looking at situations where prices are not allowed to perform this function”

Excerpt From: Thomas Sowell. “Basic Economics 4th Ed.” iBooks. 

“While telling people what to do might seem to be a more rational or orderly way of coordinating an economy, it has turned out to be far less effective in practice. ”

Excerpt From: Thomas Sowell. “Basic Economics 4th Ed.” iBooks. 

“The sight of aisle after aisle of shelves neatly stacked with every conceivable type of foodstuff and household item, each in a dozen varieties, both amazed and depressed him. For Yeltsin, like many other first-time Russian visitors to America, this was infinitely more impressive than tourist attractions like the Statue of Liberty and the Lincoln Memorial”

Excerpt From: Thomas Sowell. “Basic Economics 4th Ed.” iBooks. 

The market is cordinated by prices - automatically. Human intervention is only required at the most basic level raising and lower you bid and ask prices.
